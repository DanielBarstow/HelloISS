This software communicates with the ISS, using ham radio and the APRS messaging
system. The software assembles messages which it passes to a ham radio, which in
turn sends it to the ISS.  The radio also monitors return messages from the ISS,
and then interprets and displays the APRS code.

This is also a testing environment to learn and explore the sofware and hardware
systems to make this system work.
